SUMMARY

This project called "Augmented Reality paint" was deloveped  robotical systems programing (PSR), at Universidade de Aveiro. This project consits in two sripts: " color_segmenter" and "ar_paint.py". 
The " color_segmenter" script , its used to configure color detection parameters, allowing the user to see their effects, and saving them to a json file , while "ar_paint.py" uses the color detection 
parameters from in  json file saved previously.

Usage

During  "color_segmenter" script lunch two windons are shown to the user (the camera and the mask windows) real-time mode event. where In the mask window 6 trackbars are beind shown, 
allowing the user to set in its pace  mask parameters. There is a possibility to  save configuartions, so that the  parameters can be used elsewhere, allowind the user to quickly exit from  the program. 

In "ar_paint.py",  some drawing colors alternatives are available , for example by clicking "R", "G" or "B" to change colors to red, green or blue, respectively.
In the other hand , the size of the pencil can be modified by tpressing the "+" and "-". As well , using the "c" key the  whiteboard will be cleare; "w" will save the present state of the whiteboard; 
"q" to quit the program.
